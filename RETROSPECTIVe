This project focused on building a UI + API automation framework using Cypress, Axios, Allure, and GitHub Actions CI. The goal was to create a clean, modular, and production-style framework similar to what would be used in a real banking application. Below is a short retrospective based entirely on the implementation in this repository.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. WHAT WENT WELL
------------------------------------------------------------

1. The Cypress framework structure was implemented clearly with separate folders for tests, pages, utils, support, screenshots, and videos. This made the project easy to navigate and extend.
2. UI automation using Page Object Model worked well, especially for the login success and login failure scenarios, which followed a simple and maintainable pattern.
3. Axios API utility successfully abstracted GET and POST requests, reducing repeated boilerplate code and making API tests easier to scale.
4. Data-driven testing using fixtures (loginData.json) kept credentials and test data cleanly separated from the logic.
5. Allure reporting integrated smoothly with Cypress, generating test results, logs, and HTML outputs used for debugging.
6. GitHub Actions pipeline ran reliably. It executed Cypress tests, produced artifacts (screenshots, videos, and Allure reports), and required no manual setup outside the YAML workflow.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. CHALLENGES AND TRADE-OFFS
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Allure reports cannot be opened directly from index.html and must be served using `npx allure open`, which may confuse some users.
2. Screenshots only appear on failing tests by default, leading to empty screenshot artifacts in CI unless forced to capture after each test.
